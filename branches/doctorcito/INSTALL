THIS BY NOW IS TO BE CONSIDERED DEMONSTRATION CODE QUALITY!

You need a workin installation of cups (Common Unix Printing System)
and python (2.7) to use any of the code provided here.

Just copy content of

- backend/ to your cups backend directory (usually this is on of those: 
  /usr/lib/cups/backend, /usr/lib64/cups/backend, /usr/libexec/cups/backend)
- lib/ to your python site-packages directory (usually something on the lines
  of "/usr/lib64/python/site-packages")

Restart cups to activate the now added backends.

You should now be able to use the backends. For information about URI format
have a look in the backends comments (somewhere near the top underneath the
disclaimer.
